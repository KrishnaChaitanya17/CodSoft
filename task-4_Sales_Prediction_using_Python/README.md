# **Data Science Project: Sales Prediction Using Python**
Thrilled to highlight my accomplishment in CodSoft's Task 4 â€“ a dynamic exploration in data science, centered on Sales Prediction. Guided by CodSoft's expertise, I embarked on a journey to unlock the power of data-driven insights.
Overview
This project focuses on predicting sales for a specific business using data-driven approaches. Sales prediction is a crucial task for businesses to plan resources, set targets, and make informed decisions. This project employs Python-based data science techniques to forecast sales.

# **Highlights**

**1. Importing Libraries**
Utilized Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
**2. Reading Dataset**
Loaded the sales dataset from a CSV file using pandas, providing the foundation for analysis and model training.
**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Conducted EDA to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics, examining features, distributions, correlations, and potential patterns.
**4. Data Visualization**
Created various visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices) to represent the data's properties and relationships.
**5. Splitting the Data**
Partitioned the dataset into training and testing sets, a crucial step for evaluating model performance.
**6. Model Building**
Explored different regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor) to predict sales.
**7. Model Evaluation**
Assessed model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) to quantify predictive accuracy.
