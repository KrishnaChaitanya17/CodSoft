# **Data Science Project: Predicting Titanic Survival**

Thrilled to share my accomplishment from CodSoft's Task 1 â€“ a captivating dive into data science via Titanic Survival Prediction. Guided by CodSoft, I explored data, engineered features, and assessed models, gaining a solid grasp of the process.


# **Overview**

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history, and this dataset provides an opportunity to apply data science skills to analyze and predict survival outcomes.


# **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is derived from the famous Kaggle competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster. It contains information about passengers including features like age, class, fare, and whether or not they survived.


# **Methodology**

**Data Preprocessing** : The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, categorical variables, and outliers. Features were also normalized or standardized as needed.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** : A comprehensive EDA was performed to gain insights into the relationships between different features and survival outcomes. Visualizations were used to present key findings.

**Feature Engineering** : Additional features were created to enhance the predictive power of the model. This included extracting titles from names, creating family size variables, and binning age groups.

**Model Selection** : Several machine learning algorithms were considered and evaluated. The models were trained on a subset of the data and validated using cross-validation techniques.

**Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning** : The chosen model was further fine-tuned using techniques like grid search to find the best combination of hyperparameters.

**Model Evaluation**: The model's performance was assessed using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, the model's predictions were visualized using a confusion matrix.

# **Results**

The final model achieved an accuracy of 92.86% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting Titanic survival.
